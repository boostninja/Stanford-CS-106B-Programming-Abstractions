This is a guide for anyone who is interested in learning computer science through the free online Stanford Introduction To Computer Science Programming abstraction CS106B Class. I was inspired to write up this guide after benefitting tremendously from the CS106A class guide found over [here](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/Stanford-CS-106A).

## How To Get Started 
* All the course materials are online and free! Here is the link to the course page: http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164//handouts/overview.

* Lectures can be found over at: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWiqgyzwAz_uGLSHsuYZlMX
**DO NOTE THAT MOST (IF NOT ALL) LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION ARE DEAD, USE THE LINK ABOVE FOR VIDEOS!**

* For the latest version of the software, make sure to visit the student version of the course page: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/

* Here is the link to the course reader (taken from the 2015 Winter run of this course): http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1154/materials/CS106BX-Reader.pdf

## Suggested Assignments Week 1
* Download and set up QT creator (the software you will be using): http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164//handouts/qt-creator.html
* Complete watching Lectures 1 and 2 - the first lecture is more about class formalities, so you can probably skip most of it. 
* Get started on Assignment 1 over at http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164//assn/life.html

## Suggested Assignments Week 2 
* Watch Lecture 3 and 4
* start on [assignment 1](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164//assn/life.html)
* Do [section 1.](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164//sections/section01.pdf)
* Extra Credit: Post your answers on Github. If you have a mac, simply download Github for Mac and sync your folder where you keep your assignments with github by creating a "new repository". It will automatically detect any changes you make to the folder (adding new assignments / answers for example), which you'll be able to commit and sync as well. Here is how to set up git for windows: http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/. You might need to use your terminal to get this fully set up. Ask your developer friends for help if you need to!
